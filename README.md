# QSIDE-Datathon-2022

In this analysis project, Anshul Srivastava and Aditya Pendyala delved into the legal and sentencing dynamics in Minnesota courts. The project provided a comprehensive examination of various aspects, shedding light on potential disparities within the state's judicial system.

Key findings and insights from the analysis:
1. **Jail Demographics:** The project compared the demographics of the state's population to those of its incarcerated individuals. The data indicated a significant disproportion in the prison population, with African-Americans constituting a much higher percentage in prisons compared to their representation in the general population. This pointed to potential disparities in the criminal justice system.

2. **Average Sentence Period by Offense (by Race):** The analysis further explored average sentencing periods, categorized by the type of offense and the race of the offenders. The results revealed that white offenders received, on average, shorter sentences across different offense types, highlighting disparities in sentencing.

3. **Average Sentence Period by Offense (by Sex):** The project extended its investigation to compare sentencing periods by sex. It found that, on average, females received shorter sentences for similar crimes. This observation raised questions about the underlying factors contributing to this gender-based sentencing gap.

4. **Effect of Plea on Sentence Period:** The project examined the impact of a defendant's plea on their sentence. As expected, it confirmed that sentences were generally lower for individuals who pleaded guilty. Notably, the analysis highlighted the significant increase in sentences for assault and drug-related crimes when defendants pleaded not guilty, with an increase of 174% and 113%, respectively.

This analysis provided valuable insights into the potential disparities within Minnesota's criminal justice system, particularly in terms of race, gender, and the influence of plea decisions on sentencing outcomes. It underscored the importance of addressing these disparities and promoting fairness and equity within the legal system. This project serves as a testament to my data analysis and visualization skills, as well as my commitment to addressing societal issues through data-driven exploration and insights.
